SE310 - Assignment 2
Nitish Chawla

Overview: This is a console-based Survey System written in Java.
It allows the user to:
- Create a new survey
- Add questions (True/False, Multiple Choice, Short Answer, Essay, Matching, Date)
- Display the current survey
- Save/load surveys using serialization
- Take the current survey and save responses
- Modify existing questions

If no survey is loaded when trying to display, save, take, or modify, the program prints
the required message and returns to the main menu.

The sample files are located within the 'surveys' and 'responses' directories. These files test out the functionality of each type of question. 

All input from the user is validated so that the program never crashes and no empty answers are allowed either fulfilling the requirements of the assignment.
